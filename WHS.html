                <p class="card-text">The Woodworking Honors Society at Marlboro High School, founded under the
                    leadership of esteemed teacher Mr. DellaPietro, is dedicated to promoting excellence in woodworking
                    and related trades. This organization provides a platform for students to deepen their craftsmanship
                    skills, engage in collaborative projects, and foster a community centered around the art and trade
                    of woodworking. Members are recognized for their commitment to the craft and their contributions to
                    both the school and the broader community. The society not only enhances students' technical
                    abilities but also instills values of leadership, service, and dedication to the trade.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">How to Join</h5>
                <p class="card-text">To join the Woodworking Honors Society at Marlboro High School, students should
                    demonstrate a strong commitment to woodworking and excellence in technology education. While
                    specific membership criteria for this society are not publicly detailed, it's common for honor
                    societies to consider factors such as academic achievement, leadership, service, and character. For
                    instance, the National Honor Society requires students to maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.75
                    and exhibit excellence in service, leadership, and character.

                    Similarly, the Woodworking Honors Society likely evaluates candidates based on their dedication to
                    the craft, participation in related activities, and overall academic performance.

                    To obtain precise information about the application process, eligibility requirements, and any
                    associated obligations, it's advisable to contact Mr. DellaPietro, the society's founder and
                    woodworking instructor at Marlboro High School. He can provide guidance tailored to your interests
                    and inform you about upcoming opportunities for involvement. Engaging with Mr. DellaPietro and
                    expressing your enthusiasm for woodworking will not only clarify the path to membership but also
                    demonstrate your commitment to the field..</p>
